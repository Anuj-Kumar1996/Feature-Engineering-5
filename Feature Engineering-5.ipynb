    "This encoding technique appears almost similar to Label Encoding. But, label encoding would not consider whether a variable is ordinal or not, but in the case of ordinal encoding, it will assign a sequence of numerical values as per the order of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Movie Ratings\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider an example involving movie ratings. You have a dataset with a categorical variable representing movie ratings, and you want to encode them for analysis. The ratings are \"Poor,\" \"Fair,\" \"Good,\" \"Very Good,\" and \"Excellent.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding:\n",

    "# Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique used to encode categorical variables based on the target variable's relationship with the categories. This method creates ordinal labels for categories based on the probability of a certain outcome occurring (e.g., a target event like \"churn\" or \"purchase\"). It's particularly useful when there is a clear monotonic relationship between the categorical variable's categories and the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how Target Guided Ordinal Encoding works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Calculate Probability**: For each category in the categorical variable, calculate the probability of the target event occurring within that category. This gives you an idea of how likely the target event is for each category.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Order Categories**: Order the categories based on their probabilities. Higher probabilities are assigned lower ordinal values, indicating a stronger relationship with the target event.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Assign Ordinal Labels**: Assign ordinal labels to the categories based on their order. The category with the highest probability might be assigned the label 1, the next highest 2, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "This encoding method leverages the relationship between the categorical variable and the target variable, potentially capturing valuable predictive information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Loan Default Prediction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you are working on a project to predict whether a loan applicant will default on their loan payment or not. You have a categorical variable \"Education Level\" with categories like \"High School,\" \"College,\" and \"Graduate.\" You suspect that education level might have an impact on loan defaults.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how you might use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Calculate Probability**: For each education level category, calculate the proportion of loan default cases within that category. For example:\n",
    "   - High School: 0.25 (25% of loans default)\n",
    "   - College: 0.15 (15% of loans default)\n",
    "   - Graduate: 0.10 (10% of loans default)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Order Categories**: Order the categories based on their default probabilities:\n",
    "   - Graduate (lowest default rate)\n",
    "   - College\n",
    "   - High School (highest default rate)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Assign Ordinal Labels**: Assign ordinal labels to the categories based on their order:\n",
    "   - Graduate: 1\n",
    "   - College: 2\n",
    "   - High School: 3\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, you've created an ordinal encoding for \"Education Level\" based on its relationship with loan default. The encoding reflects the likelihood of loan default decreasing as education level increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding can be useful when you suspect that a categorical variable has a monotonic relationship with the target variable, and you want to capture this relationship for better predictive performance. However, it's important to carefully validate and test the results to ensure the encoding improves the model's accuracy."

    "**Covariance** is a statistical concept that measures the degree to which two random variables change together. In other words, it quantifies the extent to which changes in one variable are associated with changes in another variable. A positive covariance indicates that both variables tend to increase or decrease together, while a negative covariance suggests that one variable increases as the other decreases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance is important in statistical analysis for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Relationship Detection**: Covariance helps identify whether two variables move in the same direction (positive covariance) or in opposite directions (negative covariance). This information is crucial for understanding potential relationships between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Portfolio Management**: In finance, covariance plays a role in analyzing the relationship between the returns of different assets. It helps in diversifying investment portfolios by selecting assets that are not strongly correlated, reducing risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Risk Assessment**: Covariance assists in measuring the risk associated with a set of variables. High positive covariance indicates that when one variable is high, the other is also likely to be high, increasing overall risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Feature Selection**: In machine learning and data analysis, understanding the covariance between features helps in selecting relevant features and avoiding multicollinearity (high correlation between features).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Economics and Social Sciences**: Covariance is used to analyze relationships between economic variables (e.g., income and spending) and social variables (e.g., education and income inequality).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Calculating Covariance**:\n",
    "\n",
    "For a pair of variables X and Y, the covariance (cov) is calculated using the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\text{cov}(X, Y) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \\bar{X})(Y_i - \\bar{Y})}{n-1} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( X_i \\) and \\( Y_i \\) are individual data points in the variables X and Y.\n",
    "- \\( \\bar{X} \\) and \\( \\bar{Y} \\) are the means of X and Y, respectively.\n",
    "- \\( n \\) is the number of data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the magnitude of the covariance is not standardized, so its value can vary greatly depending on the scale of the variables. This makes it difficult to interpret in isolation. To address this, the concept of correlation is often used, which is a standardized form of covariance that ranges between -1 and 1, making it easier to compare relationships across variables with different scales."

    "For the given categorical variables in your dataset (\"Gender,\" \"Education Level,\" and \"Employment Status\"), the appropriate encoding methods would depend on the nature of the variables and the relationships between their categories. Here's how you could approach the encoding for each variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Gender (Binary Categorical Variable: Male/Female)**:\n",
    "   Since \"Gender\" is a binary categorical variable with only two categories (Male and Female), you can use label encoding or binary encoding. Both methods would work effectively in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Label Encoding**: Assign \"Male\" as 0 and \"Female\" as 1. This is a simple and straightforward encoding that captures the binary nature of the variable.\n",
    "   - **Binary Encoding**: Create a single binary feature column (0 or 1) representing gender, where \"Male\" is encoded as 0 and \"Female\" as 1. This maintains the binary distinction in a more explicit manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Given that the gender variable is binary, either label encoding or binary encoding would be suitable. However, binary encoding might be a slightly more informative choice, as it explicitly emphasizes the binary distinction between the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Education Level (Nominal Categorical Variable: High School/Bachelor's/Master's/PhD)**:\n",
    "   \"Education Level\" is a nominal categorical variable with multiple categories. In this case, one-hot encoding is the preferred method.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **One-Hot Encoding**: Create separate binary columns for each education level category. Each column indicates the presence (1) or absence (0) of a particular education level. This method captures the non-ordinal relationship between education levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "   One-hot encoding is used because \"Education Level\" doesn't have a meaningful ordinal relationship where one level is inherently greater or lesser than another. Each education level is a distinct category with no inherent order, so one-hot encoding preserves the categorical nature of the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Employment Status (Nominal Categorical Variable: Unemployed/Part-Time/Full-Time)**:\n",
    "   Similar to \"Education Level,\" \"Employment Status\" is a nominal categorical variable without a clear ordinal relationship among its categories. Hence, one-hot encoding is the appropriate choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **One-Hot Encoding**: Create separate binary columns for each employment status category. Each column represents whether the individual falls into a specific employment category (e.g., \"Unemployed,\" \"Part-Time,\" \"Full-Time\").\n",
    "\n",
    "   Again, one-hot encoding is used to represent the distinct employment categories without implying any ordinal relationship among them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the suitable encoding methods for the given categorical variables are:\n",
    "- Gender: Binary Encoding (or Label Encoding)\n",
    "- Education Level: One-Hot Encoding\n",
    "- Employment Status: One-Hot Encoding\n",
